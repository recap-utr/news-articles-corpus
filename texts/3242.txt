Blame John Oliver. A dancing zebra became an overnight sensation on Sunday after the host of HBO's "Last Week Tonight"?released a 23-minute clip of the-zebra dancing, sitting, gesturing and more, all in front of a green screen. This allowed fans to add the zebra to footage of just about anything "?so far, mostly clips of President Donald Trump "?along with the #JustAddZebras-hashtag.- Why? Partially because of a program in Bolivia where people dressed as zebras and directed traffic. But mostly because it's a dancing zebra. Is there anything better than that? Here's a sampling:- Zebra makes Trump appears to ignore requests for a handshake with Angela Merkel #JustAddZebras pic.twitter.com/3mdWSmbBEd Everything is better with a zebra! #justaddzebras .@LastWeekTonight I haven't laughed so hard in a very long time..and off the couch!#justaddzebras also this:https://t.co/UBXKhap5Ye thank you @LastWeekTonight #justaddzebras. possibly the greatest thing ever to appear on TV #justaddzebras I just learnt to use green screen.
