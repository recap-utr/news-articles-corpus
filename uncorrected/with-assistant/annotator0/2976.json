      "text": "VLADIVOSTOK, March 19. /TASS/. Yulia Samoilova, who will represent Russia at the Eurovision-2017 song contest in Ukraine dismissed as \"laughable\" the Ukrainian authorities\"?threats not to allow her cross the country's border. \"It's all laughable, and I don\"t understand why they made such a big fuss of it,\" the wheelchair-bound singer said in a Rossiya 1 TV channel broadcast, Saturday News with Sergei Brilev.   Commenting on allegations that her Eurovision entry was a PR move and a provocation by the Russian authorities, Samoilova said that she had to face other people's prejudices her entire life. \"Opinions differ,\" she said, adding that the aim of her participation was \"to show that any person is capable of anything\"?and that if you have a dream, you can always achieve it.\" On March 12, it was announced that wheelchair-bound singer Yulia Samoilova will represent Russia at the 2017 Eurovision Song Contest to be held in Ukraine's capital Kiev on May 9-13. Ukraine's security service SBU said earlier that Samoilova performed at a festival dubbed \"A World of Sports and Kindness\" held in Russia's Crimea on June 27, 2015 and thus violated the Ukrainian government's regulation which stipulates that foreign citizens should receive a special permission in order to enter Crimea. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Pavel Klimkin said that choosing Samoilova to represent Russia at the contest was a provocation. Meanwhile, the contest's Executive Supervisor Jon Ola Sand said that the European Broadcasting Union had no objection against Samoilova's participation.",
